'''This library is meant to be used as a tool to create external scrips for minecraft. It is NOT a library for creating plugins or forge modifications, clients or datapacks.
Examples of external scripts would be, an AFK Grinder, Anti-AFK script, Auto-Walker etc. It's all up to you and your imagination! It does NOT connect to your game, but instead,
it simulates your movements in a way that reproduces ingame actions. The usage of this library may be against the rules of some Minecraft Servers. Use it at your own risk.'''
